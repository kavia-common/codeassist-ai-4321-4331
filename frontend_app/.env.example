# Frontend environment variables
# Copy this file to ".env" and adjust as needed.
# Important: If your frontend is served over HTTPS, set this to an HTTPS backend origin to avoid mixed-content blocking.
# Example for local dev (both HTTP):
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001

# Example for HTTPS preview environments (adjust host/port to your backend):
# REACT_APP_BACKEND_BASE_URL=https://<your-backend-host>:3001

REACT_APP_BACKEND_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
